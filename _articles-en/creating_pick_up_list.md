### **Step 4**

Choose “Pick-up List Type”:
- "Fixed pick-up time" - interval time option "НН:ММ - НН:ММ" (e.g., "12:00 - 13:00");
- "Allow customer to choose a pick-up time"; 
- "Fixed time before tour starts" - a difference between the start time of the tour and tour duration.

Customers or Agents are allowed to change pick-up time only if you set “Allow Customer to choose a pick-up time” in “Pick-up List Type” dropdown. Suppliers and employees can always change the pick-up time.

If a area (or location) has a price then price type must be selected:
- "Per vehicle - private transfer". If this option is selected then max seats count must be indicated also;
- "Per person - group transfer". If this option is selected then max seats is unlimited.

### **Step 8**

Click on the “Save” button. Pick-up list can’t be saved without any area or location. But if the checkbox "Allow customer to request other Area" ("Allow customer to request other Location") is turned on, then pick-up list can be saved without them. 

### **Step 9**

Add pick-up list to a session or schedule on tour setup step “Schedule”.
