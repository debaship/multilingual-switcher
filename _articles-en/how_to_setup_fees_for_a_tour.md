### **Step 3**

Fill the required fields:
- "Name" - fee name;
- "The listed price includes this fee" - checkbox, if turned on, the amount isn’t displayed in booking in “Total > Fees & Taxes”, because the fee amount is already included in the tour amount;
- “Rate Type” - dropdown with 2 values:
	- “Per booking” - fee amount for the booking;
	- “Per person” - fee amount for the selected participants. Click “Select participants” for the necessary selection of participants;
- “Amount” - fee amount (“$” or “%”);
- “Apply to” - dropdown with 2 values:
	- "Everyone" - for every customer;
	- "Custom countries" - for selected countries. Click “Countries > Add country”.
