### **Subscription expiration pending requests**

10 days before the expiration of the subscription, a notification is displayed for the owner and employees of the companies in "Top menu > Pending request".

For the company owner, such a notification is displayed with the "Update" which redirects to "Billing & Payments" section, and the "Take Credit Period" button for the opportunity to take a credit period for 10 days.

For manager and other employees, only a notification without buttons is displayed, since employees cannot pay for the subscription.

### **Displayig notifications for expired subscription**

If the company is blocked due to an unpaid subscription, new bookings inside the system and notifications come to "Top menu > Pending Requests"

If the company has expired 10 days for payment and the company becomes blocked, messages in the "Top menu > Messages" do not come. After the subscription is paid, the messages in "Messages" will be displayed again.

### **Subscription payment acceptance messages**

After the administrator confirms or rejects the bank transfer, the user will see the corresponding message in "Top menu > Messages".

If his payment is confirmed, the message "Your subscription payment was confirmed" is displayed.
