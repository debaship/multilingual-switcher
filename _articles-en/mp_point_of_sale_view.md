### **Step 1**

Go to "Marketplace".

Select view mode.

View mode is displayed in the second header in the "Marketplace" section. There are 3 view modes:
- "Admin view";
- "List view";
- "Point of sale view".

At "Point of sale view" mode booking creates through modal "Checkout". "Point of sale view" differs from the "List view" in that there are tabs in the left sidebar (filters and buttons "Liked", "My tours" and the main header of the site are remain).
