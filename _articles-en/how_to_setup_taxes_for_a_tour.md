### **Step 3**

Fill the required fields:
- "Name" - fee name;
- "The listed price includes this tax" - checkbox, if turned on, the amount isn’t displayed in booking in “Total > Fees & Taxes”, because the tax amount is already included in the tour amount;
- "Compound" - option, that provides calculation of margins from all taxes. If interest is included in "Amount", then "Compound tax" is considered by this way: 
booking amount + fees amount + amount of all other taxes + percentage of compound tax. System fees and taxes that are included in the tour amount don’t consider;
- "Amount" - tax amount ("$" or "%");
- "Do not apply this tax for extras" - checkbox, if “on” this tax doesn’t apply on extras.

Add tax on the tour creation step “People & Price”.
