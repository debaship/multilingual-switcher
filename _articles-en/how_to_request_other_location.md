This option is available if the checkbox "Allow customer to request other Location" is turned on in the pick-up list settings. 

Customers and Agents can request other location at booking module in the field “Pick-up location”. 

Suppliers’ employees always can request a new location.

### **Step 1**

Go to the tour booking.

### **Step 2**

Go to the field  “Pick-up location” in the booking modal menu.

### **Step 3**

Click on the “Book now” button.
