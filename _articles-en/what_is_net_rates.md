The section "Net Rates" is used to configure net rates and payment methods for Agents.

Setup available only for Supplier companies for owners and employees (if set permission for employees in “Manage > Employees > Roles & Permissions”). So they can create and edit net rates.

At the section “Net Rates”, the tab “My Rates” opens. Sidebar on the left has 2 tabs: 
- “My Rates” - all Suppliers’ tours with tour options.
- “Agent Payment Methods” - all payment methods for Agents.
