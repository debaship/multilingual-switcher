"White Label" it's a personal place for Suppliers or Premium Agents can published not only their own tours but also tours which they had added to "My tours".

"White Label" contains 3 sections:

## **Home**

Displays a list of all tours available from the Supplier.

## **Bookings**

The section displays only for authorized users: Supplier, Agent or their employees.

It's the same as "Bookings > Booking view" section in system.

If Supplier logged in his own "White Label" then in "Bookings" section in column "Booked By" will be displayed the name of an Agent who did the booking (or Supplier's name if he did it) or the name of an employee of his company for bookings.

Agent on Supplier's "White Label" will see the bookings of other tours. In the column "Booked By" will be displayed the name of Agent's company.

For each booking there is an ellipsis menu - it contains only the "Voucher" menu item. By clicking on it opens a link to a new tab where the booking data is displayed as a voucher. The functionality is the same as in "Bookings > Manifest view".

The ellipsis menu is shown for each booking. The link to the voucher is public and does not require authorization in the system for preview it.
