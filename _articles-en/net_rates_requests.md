### **Pending net rates requests**

Pending requests notifications are located in the “Top menu > Pending requests” section for owner of a Supplier company and his employees who have a permissions.

Notification about net rates request comes to Supplier on a specific tour date (if the schedule is set up, but pricing seasonal rules are not available).

Or goes to the company from “Marketplace > Find Suppliers”.

A net rate request notification from the Supplier profile preview in “Marketplace > Find Suppliers” is generated only when the Supplier has private net rates (the checkbox “Set as Public Rates” turned off at “Manage > Net Rates > Standard Rates”).

### **Notifications about update net rates**

A notification for owner of Agent company and his employees who have permissions, arrives when the Supplier updates its net rates.

After the Supplier creates new pricing seasonal rules or changes the existing ones so that an effective pricing seasonal rules period can be obtained on the requested date the Supplier’s net rates request notification disappears and the Agent receives the corresponding message in the “Top menu > Messages” section.

### **Accepting net rates requests**

By clicking on the “Request Rates” button, the Agent sends a request - Supplier receives a notification.

When hovering over a notification, two buttons are displayed:
- “Manage Rates” - by clicking on the button, the Supplier goes to a new tab in the “Manage > Net Rates” section. The notification will be removed from the “Top menu > Pending requests” section, when the net rates are created for Agent with the requested tour and include requested date;
- “Decline” - by clicking on the button, for Agent, who requested net rates, for this date and for this tour, on all calendars the date is always displayed as “full booking”. The Agent can no longer do the same request. If the net rates request has been fulfilled, and the date has passed, and the request has not been confirmed/canceled, then the request will be canceled automatically.

When Agent requests a net rates from the “Marketplace > Find Suppliers” section, the Supplier, instead of the “Manage Rates” button, has the “Send Rates” button in the notifications in the “Top menu > Pending requests” and there is no date and name of the tour.
