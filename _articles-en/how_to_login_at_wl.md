### **Step 2**

To login as a system user, enter e-mail address and password which are set up during registration in the system. Click "Next" to complete authorisation. 

To login as an Agent, enter agent code in the "Email or Login" field and agent password in the "Password" field. Agent code and agent password are assigned to an Agent by a Supplier.

### **Step 3**

Click on "Next" button for autorization to "White Label".

### **Step 4**

For exit on the "White Label" as an authorized user, click on the "Log Out" link in the header (if an Agent is authorized) or select the "Log Out" menu item in the account menu (if the system user is authorized).

### **Suggestions**

User of an Agent company can authorize without the agent password.

Just enter an agent code and click on "Log In" button. Agent password will be ignored.

Company name will be showed at footer when user is autorized with the text "Logged in as: [Agent company name or user name]".
