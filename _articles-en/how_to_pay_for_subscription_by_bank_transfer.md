### **Step 6**

Payment confirmation.

Bank transfer could be rejected by admin.

When the bank transfer was rejected, a field “Payment Proof” will be displayed for the user for downloading a picture with a bank transfer.

After downloading a picture, a button “Send Payment Proof” will be available to send it for confirmation.
