### **Agent bookings**

Agent can makes bookings for tours in the sections:
- "Bookings > Manifest view" (only for Agent Premium or Supplier-Agent, those companies who have added foreign tours to the section "My Tours");
- "Marketplace" ("Marketplace > List view" or "Marketplace > Point-of-sale");
- "White Label" (on personal "White Label" or on Supplier's "White Label" when those Agent have been autorized).

Agent’s bookings made from "Marketplace > List view" immediately go to Supplier for confirmation; bookings made from "Marketplace > Point-of-sale" appear first in the "Checkout" module window and then go to the Supplier for confirmation.

Any type of Agent company can see his bookings which made by himself in "Bookings > Booking view", and also those bookings where Agent was indicated in "Booked By". The Agent can also change the booking data, but only if he is allowed to do this (a Supplier has enabled the "Can modify bookings" checkbox in the Agent’s profile in editing module).

If the Agent Premium makes a tour booking added to "My Tours", then he can see this booking in "Bookings > Manifest view" and "Bookings > Booking view".

Bookings of other tours that are not added to "My Tours" are only may be seen by the Agent Premium in "Bookings > Booking View" section, just like the regular Agent (Agent Online or Agent Offline).

If the Agent Premium makes a booking from "Booking > Manifest view", then this booking immediately go to a Supplier for confirmation, without falling into the "Checkout" module.
